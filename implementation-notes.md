# Implementation Notes

Running record of decisions made while building the web UI and container, especially the
ones that are not in the plan or that reinterpret it. See `docs/PLAN.md` for the history
of the CLI pipeline itself.

## 2026-07-26 — LibreOffice is a viable measurement engine (Phase 0 gate)

**What:** Compared Word-rendered PDFs against LibreOffice-rendered PDFs for all 14
`.docx` files already in `output/`, using `scripts/compare_pdf_backends.py`.

**Result:** Line counts were **identical on all 14** documents. Page counts agreed on
13 of 14. The single disagreement is `_calib_lines_final`, which is by construction the
document sitting exactly on the page boundary (it is the calibration artifact holding the
most lines that still fit one page under Word). Word fits 52 lines there, LibreOffice 51.

**Why it came out this well:** the container uses the *same font files* Word used, not
metric-compatible substitutes. `docker/fonts/` vendors the exact `Lora-VariableFont_wght.ttf`
and `NovaMono-Regular.ttf` from this machine, so glyph advances — and therefore every wrap
point — are identical. Wrapping is what `CHARS_PER_LINE` describes, which is why that
constant does not move.

**Impact:** `CHARS_PER_LINE` stays 101 under LibreOffice. A live `scripts/calibrate.py`
run inside the container later measured `LINES_PER_PAGE = 50` (not the 51 inferred from
the one mismatched baseline) — use the calibrated file, not the spike estimate. The gate
passes: LibreOffice can drive the fit loop in the container.

**Notable:** Spectral (used for section headings) is **not installed on this Windows
machine**, so Word substituted it when producing the baselines. The container installs the
real Spectral. This affects only heading glyphs, never wrapping — headings are single short
words — which the identical line counts confirm. Georgia is referenced by an unused
`Subtitle` style and is deliberately not vendored, being proprietary.

## 2026-07-26 — Calibration constants moved from source into data

**What:** `CHARS_PER_LINE` / `LINES_PER_PAGE` are now loaded from
`data/calibration/<backend>.json`, one file per PDF backend, with the Word-measured values
kept in `config.py` as the fallback.

**Why:** `scripts/calibrate.py` previously regex-rewrote `config.py` itself. That is fine
for a developer script and wrong inside a container, where the source tree may be
read-only and where two engines need two different answers.

**Tradeoff:** one more file to keep in sync, and a fresh container with no calibration file
silently inherits Word's constants. Mitigated by `config.CALIBRATION_SOURCE`, which records
whether real measurements or the fallback are in use so the report and the UI can say so.

**Spec delta:** the plan said `data/calibration/`; kept, since `data/` is already a bind
mount in compose. Note this makes calibration gitignored along with the rest of `data/`.
After first `docker compose run … python scripts/calibrate.py`, `soffice.json` appears
on the host mount (`CHARS_PER_LINE=101`, `LINES_PER_PAGE=50`).

## 2026-07-26 — Web UI serialises jobs; does not refactor `_ACTIVE`

**What:** The FastAPI job queue runs one tailoring job at a time. Concurrent submissions
queue and the UI shows position.

**Why:** `config._ACTIVE` is process-wide mutable routing state. Threading a context
object through every call site would be a large, risky diff for a single-user tool.

**Tradeoff:** No parallel runs. Documented follow-up if this becomes multi-user:
`contextvars` (or an explicit backend bag) instead of `_ACTIVE`.

**Also:** each job writes to `output/jobs/<job_id>/`; JD/score caches go to
`RESUME_TAILOR_CACHE_DIR` (default `output/`, Docker sets `output/cache`).

## 2026-07-26 — Docker one-shot

**What:** Multi-stage `Dockerfile` + `docker-compose.yml`. Node builds the SPA; runtime
is `python:3.13-slim` + `libreoffice-writer` + vendored fonts. `docker compose up --build`
serves http://localhost:8000.

**Why:** Word/COM cannot run in Linux; LibreOffice is the measurement engine in the
container (`RESUME_TAILOR_PDF_BACKEND=soffice`). Native Windows CLI still defaults to
`word`.

**Impact:** Image ~1 GB. `data/` and `templates/` are bind-mounted (gitignored). Ollama
on the host is reached via `host.docker.internal`.

**Verified:** 13-bullet current-resume subset renders to 1 page / 49 lines inside the
container with the soffice calibration loaded.

## 2026-07-26 — Master resume editor: add / remove / reorder

**What:** The SPA master-resume editor can add, remove, and reorder experience entries,
project entries, skill groups, and bullets. New bullets get client-generated ids; new
projects get `proj_<slug>` ids. Per-project GitHub URL + link label fields are editable
(schema already had `Project.link` / `Project.url`).

**Why:** The editor previously only mutated fields on fixed-length arrays. Growing the
store required hand-editing JSON. Experience keys used `${company}-${i}` and skill keys
used `g.label`, which remounted cards on every keystroke — switched to index keys
because all state is controlled from the parent `resume` object.

**Bullet ids:** Reuse the entry's existing `_bN` prefix (e.g. `aol_b4`) rather than
slugifying the company name. Prefixes in `master_resume.json` are hand abbreviations and
are not name-derivable. Ids stay read-only in the UI; uniqueness is still enforced
server-side by `MasterResume._ids_unique`.

**GitHub links:** Typing a URL into an empty label auto-fills `"Github"`. A label with
no URL warns inline (already true for `proj_zotassistant` / `proj_fuzzy_street`).
Non-http URLs warn but do not block save — matching the plain `str` schema.

**Impact:** Client completeness check blocks Save/Validate on blank bullet text/tags and
blank entry headers before the Pydantic path; server validation remains authoritative.

## 2026-07-26 — Workspace cleanup

**What:** Cleared `output/` (~30 MB of tailored docs, calibration temps, score caches),
Python `__pycache__` / `.pytest_cache`, and `frontend/dist`. Added the missing `output/`
rule under the existing `.gitignore` heading so regenerated resumes are not stageable.

**Why:** `output/` held full resumes (PII) and was only commented as ignored, not actually
ignored. Kept `data/`, `templates/`, `.venv`, `frontend/node_modules`, and
`docker/soffice.Dockerfile` (still used by `scripts/compare_pdf_backends.py`).

**Impact:** Next `docker compose up --build` or `npm run build` recreates the SPA; next
tailor run recreates job artifacts under `output/jobs/`.

## 2026-07-26 — UNDERFLOW_THRESHOLD lowered to 0.86

**What:** `config.UNDERFLOW_THRESHOLD` changed from 0.92 to 0.86.

**Why:** Live runs often started at ~10 bullets (~86% page fill after the first rewrite)
and triggered a grow round because 86% < 92%. Lowering the threshold accepts that fill on
the first measure and skips an extra rewrite pass.

**Tradeoff:** Slightly more whitespace at the bottom of a one-pager; raise back toward
0.92 if tighter packing matters more than API cost.

## 2026-07-26 — Skills lines rendered fully bold

**What:** `build_skills` in `scripts/build_template.py` now splits its tag across two runs
— `{{ group.label }}:` in the export's bold label run, ` {{ group.entries }}` in its plain
body run — instead of writing both into run 0 and deleting the rest. Template regenerated.

**Why:** Every SKILLS line in `original_export.docx` is exactly two runs (bold `AI/ML:`,
plain ` RAG pipelines, ...`). Collapsing to one run discarded the plain run's formatting,
so the whole rendered line inherited the label's bold. Same principle as `tag_header`:
formatting is inherited from the real XML, so the tags must land in the runs that carry it.

**Tradeoff:** The prototype selection now requires a line with ≥2 runs. If a future Google
Docs export merges them, the one-run fallback clones the label run and forces `bold = False`
rather than failing — a hardcoded assumption that the plain body is simply "not bold",
which holds for this resume but would not survive the body run gaining its own styling.

**Follow-up:** No regression test yet; `tests/test_render.py` skips when the template is
unbuilt, so a bolding assertion there would only run on a machine that has `templates/`.

## 2026-07-26 — Default Ollama model changed

**What:** Changed `config.OLLAMA_MODEL` from `nemotron-3-super:cloud` to
`minimax-m3:cloud`, and updated the matching examples in `tailor.py`, `.env.example`, and
`CLAUDE.md`.

**Why:** The requested default backend for the `ollama` profile is now `minimax-m3:cloud`,
so the code and user-facing configuration examples need to point at the same model.

**Impact:** Runs using `--model ollama` or the `hybrid` profile now default extract/score
to `minimax-m3:cloud` unless `OLLAMA_MODEL` or a per-run model override is set.
## 2026-07-26 � Raised MAX_TOKENS to 32,000 with per-backend clamping

**Decision:** Set `MAX_TOKENS = 32_000` in `config.py` and added `ANTHROPIC_NONSTREAMING_MAX_TOKENS = 21_333` plus a new `max_tokens_for(purpose)` accessor. All four `client.messages.parse` call sites in `jd.py` and `rewrite.py` now call `config.max_tokens_for()` instead of `config.MAX_TOKENS` directly.

**Why:** 32 k gives OpenAI-compatible and Ollama backends a larger reasoning budget. The Anthropic SDK refuses non-streaming requests above 21,333 tokens client-side (`3600 * max_tokens / 128_000 > 600`), so the higher value can't be sent as-is to Claude without breaking every run.

**Tradeoff:** Claude calls silently receive 21,333 even when MAX_TOKENS is higher. The comment on MAX_TOKENS and the new function docstring explain this, so it is visible without reading the SDK source.

**Spec delta:** User asked for `32_000`; Claude paths are capped at `21_333` to remain within the SDK's non-streaming limit.

**Follow-up:** Switching to streaming on the Anthropic path would allow the full 32 k budget there too � see `llm.py` comment on ANTHROPIC_NONSTREAMING_MAX_TOKENS.

## 2026-07-26 — Bullet merging feature (opt-in)

**What:** Implemented an optional `--merge` pass that merges redundant bullet points within the same entry. The fit loop calls `merge.propose` (pure heuristic), and `rewrite` applies accepted merges via `rewrite._merge_bullets`.

**Why:** This is a non-truncation space lever: merged output is accepted only if it is non-regressive in line-span, passes a multi-source fabrication guard, preserves every number-bearing token, and does not create a new widow (widow repair remains a later step).

**Impact:** Accepted merges delete absorbed bullet ids from the `bullets: dict[id -> text]` currency so the existing renderer automatically places the merged line where the survivor bullet appears in the master resume.
